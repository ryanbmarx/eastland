    <h2 class='chapter'>Rescue efforts</h2>
    <p class="drop-cap">Onlookers began to toss anything that would float into the river, including boards, ladders and wooden chicken crates. Some of the crates struck passengers in the water, knocking them out and putting them under.{{ footnote(8) }}</p>
    <img class="drawn-panel" src="img/30-eastland-CfinalY.jpg" />

    <p>Two tugboats rushed to pull people from the water: the Reyerson and the Rita McDonald, which had picked up two construction raftson the way. A third tugboat, the Kenosha, was tied to the Eastland. Passengers jumped from the Eastland to the Kenosha then on to the dock. The other two were credited with rescuing over 100 people from the water. One tug crewman jumped into the river to retrieve a woman who had sunk before she could be pulled aboard. After her rescue and the considerable effort by the crew, she was revived. {{ footnote(9) }}</p> 
    <img class="drawn-panel" src="img/31-eastland-CfinalY.jpg" />
    <h2 class="chapter">Diving in</h2>
    <p class="drop-cap">Volunteer deep sea divers were given the gruesome task of retrieving the dead from underwater sections of the ship. Bodies of babies, children and young women were found throughout the ship. Some  were found locked in an embrace, forcing the diver to bring them to the surface together. Many had been mangled by the violence of sliding furnishings or from being hurled against walls and crushed by weight of others.</p>
    <img class="drawn-panel" src="img/32-eastland-CfinalY.jpg" />
    <p class="drop-cap">Because the interiors of the submerged half of the ship were twisted and full of debris, the divers moved slowly and cautiously to avoid snagging their air hoses and signal ropes. Without them them was no escape from the underwater tomb, and some divers had close calls.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter">Caring for the dead</h2>
    <p class="drop-cap">Hundreds of dead were transported to the National Guard Armory â€” which was empty at the time. Morticians raced to embalm the bodies before it was impossible to do so.{{ footnote(8) }}</p>

    <img class="drawn-panel" src="img/36-eastland-CfinalY.jpg" />

    <p class="drop-cap">Many of the victims lived in Cicero. Many homes were draped with black crepe as visitations were often held at home., as was the custom at the time. It was normal to walk into an open front door to view the body in a living room or parlor. Some houses were empty because the entire family had perished in the river.</p>
    <p>To the disgust and dismay of many, pick pockets and thieves, posing as friends of the deceased, would steal jewelry off the bodies along with untended household items. Loan sharks posing as representatives of various relief funds tricked bereaved wives to sign fake 'receipts' that were actually contracts binding the signers to pay exorbitant rates of interest.{{ footnote("needone")}}</p>
    <p>The Health Department, fearing a typhoid epidemic brought on by those who had swallowed polluted Chicago River water, sent physicians and nurses to innoculate surivors even if it meant interupting visiations.{{ footnote(10) }}</p>
    <p>Wednesday, July 28, 1915 was the day that the majority of the victims were laid to rest.{{ footnote("needone")}}</p>

    <h2 class="chapter">The aftermath</h2>

    <p class="drop-cap">Despite years of finger pointing and wrangling in the courts, no payouts or compensation were ever made available to the survivors or families of the deceased. </p>

    <p>By the end of World War II, many Chicagoans knew little to nothing about the disaster. Today, a handful of historical groups are dedicated to preserving artifacts and oral accounts of the survivors and responders. </p>

    <p>The last known survivor, Marion Eichholz, died November 24, 2014 at the age of 102. Marion had turned three years old a week earlier when she boarded the Eastland with her mother and father.{{ footnote(12) }}</p>
